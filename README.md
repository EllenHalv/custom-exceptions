## Custom Exceptions Example Project

Custom exceptions are useful for providing more detailed and exact information about what has gone wrong - also making the debugging process easier.

This example project shows how to use custom exceptions to:
- Provide more detailed information about what has gone wrong
- Customize what types of exceptions can be thrown
- Make your code base cleaner by separating it from the error handling logic
- Handle exceptions globally using a 'GlobalExceptionHandler'
